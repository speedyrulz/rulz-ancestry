# RulZ Ancestry

A Windows desktop app for building a family tree and researching it with free
data sources. Everything is stored on your own PC.

Status: **Phase 0 complete** (project foundations). The app opens a window and
runs a system check; tree features start in Phase 1. See [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md)
for the full plan and [docs/ACCESS.md](docs/ACCESS.md) for the API keys and
applications that only you can request.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit
- Node.js 24 or newer
- pnpm 12 (`corepack enable` picks up the version pinned in `package.json`)

## Commands

Run these from the repository root.

| Command                  | What it does                                                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`           | Install dependencies                                            |
| `pnpm dev`               | Run the app with hot reload                                     |
| `pnpm test`              | Unit tests (Vitest)                                             |
| `pnpm typecheck`         | TypeScript check for every package                              |
| `pnpm lint`              | ESLint                                                          |
| `pnpm format`            | Format all files with Prettier                                  |
| `pnpm build`             | Production build into `apps/desktop/out`                        |
| `pnpm test:e2e`          | End-to-end tests against the production build                   |
| `pnpm package`           | Build the installer into `apps/desktop/release`                 |
| `pnpm test:e2e:packaged` | End-to-end tests against the packaged app (run `package` first) |

## Layout

```
apps/desktop          Electron app: main process, preload script, React UI, e2e tests
packages/core         Domain logic with no Electron dependency (ids now; GEDCOM, matching later)
packages/db           SQLite access (better-sqlite3)
packages/connectors   One folder per data source, each with a manifest of its limits and terms
docs/                 Plan and access checklist
```

## Rules the code follows

- **No scraping.** A source is used only through its official API, an open bulk
  dataset, or a link opened in the user's browser. Each source's manifest in
  `packages/connectors/src/sources` records which, with its rate limits and terms.
- **The UI cannot reach Node.js.** The window runs sandboxed with context
  isolation; it talks to the main process only through the functions listed in
  `apps/desktop/src/shared/ipc.ts`.
- **Development data stays separate.** `pnpm dev` stores its database in
  `%APPDATA%\RulZ Ancestry (dev)`, not in the installed app's folder.

## Dependency updates

pnpm holds back very recently published packages as a supply-chain precaution.
If an install asks to add a brand-new version to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude`,
prefer widening the version range so an older release can be used instead.
